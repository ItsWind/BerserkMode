# BerserkMode
 A mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord
 
This mod is my rendition of a "heal on kill" system to keep players in the fight. This introduces a rage system that builds up when the player gets damaged or gives damage. Rage can trigger a berserk mode which will give the player buffs for a certain duration of time.
